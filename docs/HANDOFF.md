# Session Handoff — relay-baton

> Compact, deterministic handoff for the next session (possibly a fresh/cold
> agent on a different machine). This is the relay-baton concept applied to the
> project itself. Read this first, then `git pull`.
>
> **Keep this file alive:** update it after every meaningful chunk of work (and
> before ending a session) — bump `_Last updated:_`, refresh "Where we are" /
> "Next up", and record any new machine-specific gotchas. See `CLAUDE.md` →

_Last updated: 2026-06-11 — v1.5.0-alpha.0 in progress: git tracking first
cut implemented locally (`relay-baton git status --json`, `.ai-session/git-baseline.json`,
desktop Git panel, Agent Room `/git`, and `docs/TASK-v1.5-git-tracking.md`)._

## Where we are

- **v1.4 alpha is SHIPPED** on tag **`v1.4.0-alpha.1`**. v1.5 work is now
  starting locally with read-only git tracking.
- **v1.1 is SHIPPED** on tag **`v1.1.3`**. The GitHub Release carries three
  working standalone binaries:
  - `relay-baton-linux-x64`
  - `relay-baton-macos-arm64`
  - `relay-baton-windows-x64.exe`
- All three matrix jobs are green. README "Download" links point at
  `releases/latest`, so they resolve to v1.1.3 automatically.
- `main` HEAD = the `v1.1.3` commit. Working tree should be clean.

## What v1.1 delivered

- Per-OS single-file executables via **Node SEA** (esbuild bundle → SEA blob →
  inject into a copied `node` with postject → codesign on macOS).
- Automated release pipeline: [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml),
  triggered by `v*` tags, attaches binaries to the Release.
- Tauri desktop **scaffold** in [`desktop/`](../desktop) (sidecar over the CLI,
  outside the pnpm workspace). NOT a full GUI yet — that's v1.2.
- Docs: [`RELEASE.md`](./RELEASE.md) (runbook + gotchas), this file.

## How v1.1 was hard-won (so we don't regress)

The first tag failed; it took v1.1.0 → v1.1.3 to get green. Four distinct
issues, all in `release.yml` — full detail in [`RELEASE.md`](./RELEASE.md):

1. v1.1.0 — leading `&` in a pwsh `run:` scalar = YAML anchor → invalid workflow,
   no job ran.
2. v1.1.1 — `npx --yes esbuild/postject` not on PATH → exit 127.
3. v1.1.2 — `postject@^1` doesn't exist (its "latest" is a prerelease) → ETARGET.
4. v1.1.3 — pinned exact `esbuild@0.28.0` + `postject@1.0.0-alpha.6`. ✅

## Next up: v1.5 release finalization

v1.5 feature work is implemented locally and all acceptance criteria in
[`TASK-v1.5-git-tracking.md`](./TASK-v1.5-git-tracking.md) are checked:

- `relay-baton git status` / `relay-baton git status --json`
- non-git fallback with `available:false`
- `.ai-session/git-baseline.json` on `init`
- session baseline comparison in `git status --json`
- bounded git summaries in `status --json`, `review --json`, and generated handoffs
- desktop Git panel and Agent Room `/git`

Remaining before calling v1.5 shipped:

1. Review the local diff once more.
2. Commit the v1.5 changes.
3. Push `main` only with explicit human approval.
4. Tag `v1.5.0-alpha.0` and watch the Release workflow.

## Next after v1.5

Do not start v1.6 until v1.5 is committed/tagged or the user explicitly asks to
keep it local. Likely v1.6 candidates:

- Desktop auto-update, opt-in and confirmation-first, from the v1.4 deferred
  item.
- Real-window QA / stable promotion cleanup for desktop releases.
- A deeper Git tracking follow-up only if the user wants it, still read-only.

Hard rule remains: GUI calls the CLI sidecar only. **No business logic in the
webview.** Read-only or confirmation-first. No auto commit/push/PR unless the
human explicitly asks for it.

## Environment notes (this dev machine)

- `pnpm` is **not** on PATH directly. Use `corepack enable --install-directory
  /tmp/rbshim pnpm && export PATH=/tmp/rbshim:$PATH`, or just `corepack pnpm`.
- `npx esbuild` fails locally too — install globally
  (`npm i -g esbuild@0.28.0 postject@1.0.0-alpha.6`) and call the bin directly.
- `gh` CLI availability is **machine-specific** — re-check on each machine.
  - On the original Linux dev box it was unusable (config root-owned, 0600), so
    the human checked Actions/Releases in the browser.
  - On the Windows dev box it works fine: `gh 2.91.0`, logged in as `dgl1231`
    (token scopes `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `gist`) — use `gh` directly
    for Actions/Releases/PRs there.
- Repo branch protection prints "Changes must be made through a pull request" on
  push, but the push still lands on `main` (confirm with `git rev-parse
  origin/main`). Tags push cleanly.

## How to cut the next release

See [`RELEASE.md`](./RELEASE.md) → "TL;DR — cut a release". Short version: bump
versions everywhere, add release notes (en+ko) + index, update README badge,
commit, push, then `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.

## Verify everything still works

```bash
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm test      # expect 7 files / 39 tests passing
```
